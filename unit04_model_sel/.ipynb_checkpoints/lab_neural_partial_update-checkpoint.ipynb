Neurons communicate with one another via *spikes* or *action potentials* which are brief events where voltage in the neuron rapidly rises then falls.  These spikes trigger the electro-chemical signals between one neuron and another.  In this experiment, the spikes were recorded from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of a monkey using an electrode array implanted onto the surface of a monkey's brain.
